# Testing Guide for Discord Chat Cleaner

## üß™ Testing Options

This program includes several testing modes to verify functionality without risking your Discord account:

### 1. Test Mode (Recommended First Step)
```bash
npm test
```
Or directly:
```bash
node src/index.js --test
```

This mode:
- Uses simulated Discord data
- Tests all features without connecting to Discord
- Allows you to practice using the interface
- Verifies all components work correctly

### 2. Dry Run Mode (Test with Real Account)
```bash
npm run test:dry
```
Or:
```bash
node src/index.js --dry-run
```

This mode:
- Connects to your real Discord account
- Fetches real channels and messages
- **DOES NOT delete any messages**
- Shows exactly what would be deleted
- Perfect for testing before actual use

### 3. Interactive Test Suite
```bash
npm test
```

Choose from:
1. **Full test mode** - Complete interactive simulation
2. **Quick functionality test** - Verify all components work
3. **Test authentication only** - Test login methods without connecting

## üìã Step-by-Step Testing Process

### Step 1: Initial Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the test suite
npm test
```

### Step 2: Test Authentication Methods
1. Run test mode: `npm test`
2. Select option 3: "Test authentication only"
3. Try each authentication method:
   - Browser cookie detection
   - Email/password login
   - QR code login
   - Manual token entry

### Step 3: Simulate Message Deletion
1. Run test mode: `npm test`
2. Select option 1: "Run full test mode"
3. Choose "Simulate message deletion"
4. Select a test channel
5. Enter number of messages to delete
6. Watch the simulation

### Step 4: Dry Run with Real Account (Optional)
```bash
# Only do this after successful test mode
npm run test:dry
```

This will:
1. Actually connect to Discord
2. Show your real servers and channels
3. Fetch your real messages
4. **Simulate** deletion without actually deleting

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works
Run the quick test:
```bash
npm test
# Select option 2: Quick functionality test
```

Should show all green checkmarks:
- ‚úì Package dependencies check
- ‚úì Authentication module loaded
- ‚úì Discord client initialized
- ‚úì Message deletion logic verified
- ‚úì Error handling confirmed

## üîç What to Look For

### Successful Test Indicators:
- All dependencies install without errors
- Test mode runs without crashes
- Authentication simulation works
- Message deletion simulation completes
- No error messages in console

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**Issue**: Dependencies won't install
```bash
# Clear npm cache and retry
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

**Issue**: Test mode won't start
```bash
# Check Node.js version (need v14+)
node --version

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Issue**: Authentication test fails
- Make sure you're following the prompts correctly
- In test mode, any input is accepted

## üéØ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Functionality
1. Run `npm test`
2. Select "Quick functionality test"
3. Verify all checks pass

### Scenario 2: Full Workflow Simulation
1. Run `npm test`
2. Select "Run full test mode"
3. Test each menu option:
   - Simulate deletion
   - View test messages
   - Test authentication
   - Run dry-run

### Scenario 3: Dry Run with Real Data
1. Run `npm run test:dry`
2. Authenticate with your Discord account
3. Select a channel with messages you've sent
4. Enter a small number (like 5) for deletion count
5. Verify it shows your actual messages but doesn't delete them

## ‚úÖ Ready for Real Use?

After successful testing:
1. All test modes work without errors ‚úì
2. Dry run mode shows correct messages ‚úì
3. You understand the interface ‚úì
4. You've read the warnings about Discord TOS ‚úì

Then you can run the actual program:
```bash
npm start
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Tips

1. **Always test first** - Use test mode before real mode
2. **Start small** - Delete just a few messages first
3. **Use dry run** - Verify what will be deleted
4. **Check the channel** - Make sure you're in the right place
5. **Backup important info** - Deleted messages can't be recovered

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If tests fail, check:
1. Node.js version: `node --version` (need v14+)
2. All files are present in src/ directory
3. Dependencies installed: `npm install`
4. No antivirus blocking the program
